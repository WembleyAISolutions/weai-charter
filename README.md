# WEAI Charter

Constitutional Sovereignty Layer of the WEAI Ecosystem.

---

## What This Repository Is

This repository defines the **constitutional authority layer** of WEAI.

It establishes:

- Structural sovereignty
- Canonical hierarchy of components
- Non-bypassable governance constraints
- Layer dependency direction

All WEAI foundational systems MUST comply with this Charter.

---

## WEAI Constitutional Layer Model

WEAI is structured into five immutable layers:

1. Charter (Sovereignty Layer)
2. Canon (Normative Rule Layer)
3. Kernel (Deterministic Execution Engine)
4. Runtime (Commercial & Policy Enforcement Layer)
5. Registry (Skill & Schema Authority Layer)

Dependency direction is strictly top-down.

Lower layers may NOT override higher layers.

---

## Authority Scope

This repository governs:

- Structural design of WEAI ecosystem
- Layer interaction boundaries
- Mutation constraints
- Amendment protocol
- Sovereignty rules

It does NOT implement runtime logic or domain business logic.

WEAI is not a product.  
It is a structural execution civilization.
